# Basic AI-Powered Image Generation

## Overview
This Jupyter notebook based project demonstrates a basic AI-powered image generation technique using a combination of pre-trained models including InceptionV3 and CLIP.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- TensorFlow
- Transformers
- OpenCV (cv2)
- NumPy

## Installation
```bash
pip install tensorflow transformers opencv-python numpy
```

## Features
- Image preprocessing
- Noise generation
- Virtual image creation using text prompts
- Image blending

## Usage
1. Specify the base image path
2. Enter a text prompt describing the desired image modification
3. Run the script to generate a blended image

### Example
```python
base_img = "path/to/your/image.jpg"
text_prompt = "Add a sunset effect"
virtual = virtual_image(base_img, text_prompt)
cv2.imwrite("generated_image.jpg", virtual)
```

## How It Works
The script uses:
- CLIP model for text understanding
- InceptionV3 for feature extraction
- Gradient descent for image generation
- Blending techniques to combine original and generated images

## Limitations
- Requires pre-trained models
- Image generation quality depends on input image and text prompt
- Computationally intensive
